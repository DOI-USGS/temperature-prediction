        title1: "",//"We know a lot about temperature. But there's a lot we don't know too.",
        paragraph1: "At first glance, it appears that there is a lot of information about stream temperature in the Basin. The map below shows all of the locations where the USGS or other agencies have ever measured the temperature of medium to large streams.",
        paragraph3: "The USGS has been monitoring temperature in the Delaware River Basin since 1901, and has amassed over 450,000 site-days worth of temperature measurements. Temperature monitoring really picked up in the mid-1960s, and has grown considerably in recent decades.",
        paragraph4: "Since 2017, an uptick in temperature monitoring can be attributed to the USGS's Next Generation Water Observing Systems (NGWOS). NGWOS is a targeted effort in the Delaware River Basin to develop and apply new monitoring techniques for a wide range of water characteristics.",
        paragraph5: "Temperature is one of the most widely measured water characteristics in the U.S. â€“ temperature can now be monitored by boat, by camera, by drone, by cable, by satellite, by sensor, or by the tried and true method of a field technician sticking a thermometer into the water.",
        title2: "Data Availability",
        subtitle2: "But don't let the sheer amount of data fool you. Most records of stream tempearture are concentrated at just a few sites across the basin.",
        paragraph6: "The top 1% of measured river reaches - only about 5 sites - makes up nearly 20% of all data. There are whole chunks of space and time where we don't know anything about the river, where we are \"in the dark.\"",
        tiptextMobile: "Watch below as the stream reaches in the Basin light up if they were monitored for temperature in each of the last forty years.",
        tiptextDesktop: "Explore the availability of temperature observations across the Delaware River Basin by selecting a river reach (on the left) or a year (on the right) to explore where and when we have the most information.",
        paragraph8: "To show how gaps in temperature observations in space and time might impact our understanding of the river, we've simplified data availability into a matrix.",
        title3: "Water Temperature Dynamics",
        paragraph10: "Our understanding of temperature dynamics in the basin gets even more complicated by the fact than not all streams behave the same way. Features of the landscape can have large effects on water temperature that create differences in temperature dynamics. Groundwater inputs, reservoirs, and urban areas all have distinct temperature signatures.",
        paragraph11: "If we look at a single year of data, we can see that stream temperatures are not uniform throughout the basin.",
        paragraph12: "In 2019, an urban reach in Philadelphia was the warmest stream reach in the basin, while a reach below the Beltzville Resevoir was the coolest. These reaches aren't that far from eachother as the crow flies, but they experience very different temperature regimes.",
        paragraph13: "The matrix below shows a year of actual temperature data across all monitored sites in medium to large streams in the Delaware River Basin.",
        title4: "Implications for Temperature Modeling",
        paragraph14: "Data sparsity and variability in stream temperature across the network limit our ability to answer questions like: How far downstream will a cold water release affect temperature?  How has fish habitat changed through time?  Will we have enough cold water in the reservoir in 50 years?",
        paragraph15: "These challenges are not unique to the Delaware River Basin. In fact, relative to the rest of the United States, the Delaware River Basin is one of the most highly monitored bains in the country. How can we create models that are robust to a diversity of temperature dynamics, in places and times where we don't have a lot of information?
