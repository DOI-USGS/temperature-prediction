        title1: "The Delaware River Basin",//"We know a lot about temperature. But there's a lot we don't know too.",
        paragraph1: "The Delaware River Basin covers 13,500 square miles in parts of four states, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. The Delaware River is rich in history, ecologically diverse, and critical to the regional economy.",
        paragraph2: "Water managers in this region have a long history of applying innovative, regional solutions to ensure the long-term sustainability of this resource, which provides drinking water to over 15 million people in the region.",
        paragraph3: "Many species – including economically important game species like brook trout and endangered species like the Dwarf wedgemussel – thrive or spawn in specific temperature ranges. Increases in river water temperature are happening all over the globe, and in the Delaware River Basin, urbanization, climate change, and human modification of hydrology can all increase water temperature. Fortunately, water managers in the upper portion of the basin can modify stream temperature via cold water releases from New  York City reservoirs. The ability to predict water temperature, and therefore make an educated guess at when, where, and how much cold water to release can help protect cold water habitat in the Delaware River basin.",
        paragraph4: "Basin-wide monitoring of water temperature underpins our understanding of water temperature dynamics in the Delaware River Basin. Modeling water temperature dynamics can help fill gaps in observations and our knowledge. Here, we explore USGS temperature monitoring and state-of-the-art modeling techniques to predict water temperature in the Delaware River Basin.",
        paragraph5: "At first glance, it appears that there is a lot of information about stream temperature in the Delaware River Basin. The map below shows all of the locations where the USGS or other agencies have ever measured the temperature of medium to large streams.",
        paragraph6: "The USGS has been monitoring temperature in the Delaware River Basin since 1901, and has amassed over 450,000 site-days worth of temperature measurements. Temperature monitoring really picked up in the mid-1960s, and has grown considerably in recent decades.",
        paragraph7: "Since 2017, the growth in temperature monitoring can be attributed to the USGS's Next Generation Water Observing System (NGWOS). NGWOS is a targeted effort in the Delaware and two other river basins to develop and apply new monitoring techniques for a wide range of water characteristics.",
        paragraph8: "Temperature is one of the most widely measured water characteristics in the U.S. – temperature can now be monitored by boat, by camera, by drone, by fiber optic cable, by satellite, by sensor, or by the tried and true method of a field technician sticking a thermometer into the water.",
        title2: "Data Availability",
        paragraph9: "But don't let the sheer amount of data fool you. Most records of stream tempearture are concentrated at just a few sites across the basin.",
        paragraph10: "The top 1% of measured river reaches - only about 5 sites - makes up nearly 20% of all data. There are whole chunks of space and time where we don't know anything about the river, where we are \"in the dark.\"",
        tiptextMobile: "Watch below as the stream reaches in the Basin light up if they were monitored for temperature in each of the last forty years.",
        tiptextDesktop: "Explore the availability of temperature observations across the Delaware River Basin by selecting a river reach (on the left) or a year (on the right) to explore where and when we have the most information.",
        paragraph11: "To show how gaps in temperature observations in space and time might impact our understanding of stream temperature dynamics, we can represent the availability of data as a matrix with two axes: space and time.",
        title3: "Water Temperature Dynamics",
        paragraph12: "Our understanding of temperature dynamics in the basin gets even more complicated by the fact than not all streams behave the same way. Features of the landscape can have large effects on water temperature that create differences in temperature dynamics. Groundwater inputs, reservoirs, and urban areas all have distinct temperature signatures.",
        paragraph13: "If we look at a single year of data, we can see that stream temperatures are not uniform throughout the basin.",
        paragraph14: "In the summer of 2019, an urban reach in Philadelphia was the warmest stream reach in the basin, while a reach below the Beltzville Resevoir was the coolest. These reaches aren't that far from each other as the crow flies, but they experience very different temperature regimes.",
        paragraph15: "The matrix below shows a year of actual temperature data across all sites in medium to large streams in the Delaware River Basin.",
        paragraph16: "How can we create models that are robust to a diversity of temperature dynamics, in places and times where we don't have a lot of information? Visit the Model chapter to learn about innovative modeling techniques to predict water temperature."
